# YOLOv8-Car-Detection
## Overview
This repository implements a car detection system using the powerful YOLOv8 object detection framework. It leverages transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained YOLOv8 model for accurately identifying cars in images.

## Features
* Car detection using YOLOv8
* Transfer learning for fine-tuning pre-trained models
* Easily customizable for different datasets and use cases
